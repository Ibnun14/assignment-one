                In 1988, Paris Croissant launched Paris Baguette, a popular bakery café franchise brand in South Korea. As of 2018, the chain had over 3,316 retail stores in South Korea.Now we are in all over South Korea and we have 57 stores in the United States. Paris Baguette also launched almost 185 retail stores in China, Vietnam, Singapore and France. We've recently opened our 10 branches in Bangladesh. The Paris Baguette brand has projected a premium high-end brand image that emphasises the baguette’s ‘Frenchness’: from its name and the Eiffel tower logo, to its staff dressed in Breton-style striped tops. Other points of differentiation include superior food quality, healthy and fresh ingredients, being freshly baked at the stores just like in traditional European bakeries, a modern and diversified menu, and a continuous introduction of new innovative products. This focus on operational innovation, quality control, new product development and brand differentiation was responsible for its exponential growth.he company’s success was primarily driven by its emphasis to provide an innovative fare with a modern and wide selection of fresh, clean and healthy products. <br> <br>
