                In 1988, Paris Croissant launched Paris Baguette, a popular bakery café franchise brand in South Korea. As of 2018, the chain had over 3,316 retail stores in South Korea.Now we are in all over South Korea and we have 57 stores in the United States. Paris Baguette also launched almost 185 retail stores in China, Vietnam, Singapore and France. We've recently opened our 10 branches in Bangladesh. The Paris Baguette brand has projected a premium high-end brand image that emphasises the baguette’s ‘Frenchness’: from its name and the Eiffel tower logo, to its staff dressed in Breton-style striped tops. Other points of differentiation include superior food quality, healthy and fresh ingredients, being freshly baked at the stores just like in traditional European bakeries, a modern and diversified menu, and a continuous introduction of new innovative products. This focus on operational innovation, quality control, new product development and brand differentiation was responsible for its exponential growth.he company’s success was primarily driven by its emphasis to provide an innovative fare with a modern and wide selection of fresh, clean and healthy products. <br> <br>

                    Every cake we offer is handcrafted and since each chef has his/her own way of baking and designing a cake, there might be slight variation in the product in terms of design and shape. The chosen delivery time is an estimate and depends on the availability of the product and the destination to which you want the product to be delivered. Since cakes are perishable in nature, we attempt delivery of your order only once. The delivery cannot be redirected to any other address.

                    Store cream cakes in a refrigerator. Fondant cakes should be stored in an air conditioned environment. Slice and serve the cake at room temperature and make sure it is not exposed to heat. Use a serrated knife to cut a fondant cake. Sculptural elements and figurines may contain wire supports or toothpicks or wooden skewers for support. Please check the placement of these items before serving to small children. The cake should be consumed within 24 hours. Enjoy your cake!

                    Surprise your loved ones this Valentine’s Day or make any day a little extra special with this Hidden Heart Cake. Start with a box cake mix and end up with this loaf cake topped with a buttery, powdered sugar glaze.You can eat the cake plain if you’d like, but why not frost it with a melt in your mouth, buttery, powdered sugar frosting? You can make half a recipe if you’d just like a little layer. Tint the frosting pink or whatever color your loved one likes. We like to just leave it plain white so the heart in the center stands out.
